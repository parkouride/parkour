parkour
=======

**I've changed focus on this project. The IDE is more important than a VM on the arduino, so let's just directly write arduino code**

**This is a work in progress, nothing works yet**

An IDE for designing LED displays / interactions that generated microprocessor code
for you, so you can concentrate on just designing the led displays and not worry
about all the code.


**Why is it named parkour?** I named the project parkour because that's what I'm going to be doing while wearing the devices that I'm making.  I'm going to be light painting with my body when this system is finished.

hardware
--------

Details coming soon, but you need at least,
[arduino](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/11113),
and [leds](https://www.adafruit.com/products/1426)

My hardware setup also includes an [IMU](https://www.adafruit.com/products/1604) for
adding interactivity to the device.
